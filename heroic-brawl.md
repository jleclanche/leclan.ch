# Heroic Tavern Brawl

I'm very torn on the [Heroic Tavern Brawl]({{ page.announcementurl }}).

When it was announced, I didn't quite read everything and I assumed it was a new game mode.
A new Tavern Brawl mode where you play more competitively.

This brawl is... constructed? Basically? It's interesting, I suppose...
I feel like it's a little dishonest to make this a tavern brawl at all.
Tavern Brawls are, to me, the essence of what's *good* in Hearthstone right now.
An ultra-competitive tavern brawl, with an exorbitant entry fee, goes in the exact opposite direction.

Let's talk about the entry fee actually... I really wonder how that price point (currently $10 or 1000 gold) was reached.
A lot of people on Reddit are arguing it's a way to drain gold before the expansion is announced.
I'm sure it crossed Blizzard's mind, but I don't think it's the primary driver for such a high price point.
This brawl is, by definition, hyper-competitive and the price point is meant to *deter* players from signing up.
If Blizzard wanted to drain leftover gold, I suspect this is very ineffective.
It could be even less effective if the pack rewards ramp up very quickly and going more than 3-3 yields over 10 packs.

What I see is that Team 5 is trying its hand at "soft tournaments". It sounds like this particular brawl could be the
result of internal design around a tournament mode: A high entry fee constructed single-deck standard game mode with big rewards depending on how well you do.
Putting this in a Tavern Brawl means they get to experiment with the format's success for a week and decide on more permanent options afterwards.

Extrapolating from that and keeping in mind that "tournament mode" is one of the most loudly requested features *and* that we know it's been worked on in the past,
I could see a "permanent" Tournament Mode coming out of this next year.
I do not think there will be enough time to draw concrete conclusions from the brawl before BlizzCon.
They may talk about it, but they can't possibly announce anything there... (can they? They have a whole expansion to worry about already)

Maybe the timing worked out this way because they wanted the nerfs to be live first. But the meta is *very* stale regardless of the nerfs. At least Arena decks are different every time.
On the other hand, releasing it shortly after the expansion would minimize its impact on the staleness of the game. Tough choice.

In summary, I dislike how (but understand why) it's hijacking the Tavern Brawl game mode. I'm not a fan of the timing either. I would have liked more details in the disappointingly short "Designer Insights" video.
I think I would be a lot more excited about it if there were some deckbuilding rules in place at least (ban enough cards to force a new meta) but maybe the entry fee will create a new meta all by itself.
